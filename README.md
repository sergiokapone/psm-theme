# [PSM Color Scheme for VSCode](https://github.com/sergiokapone/psm-theme)

Enhance your coding experience with the new "**P**rogramming and **S**cripting **M**anagement" color scheme for **VS Code**. This theme is perfect for programmers and script developers looking for a more appealing and professional interface for their work. "Programming and Scripting Management" offers a unique combination of bright colors and subtle lines that make reading code easier and increase productivity.

Also, this theme is an excellent choice for those who work with JavaScript and Python, particularly in the field of Data Science. It combines pleasant tones and improved syntax highlighting, making code easier to read and understand. Moreover, thanks to its greenish hue, the theme is easy on the eyes and code elements are clearly visible. Based on the color scheme of the popular [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which is highly regarded by data scientists.
