# [PSM Color Scheme for VSCode](https://github.com/sergiokapone/psm-theme)

Enhance your coding experience with the new "**P**rogramming and **S**cripting **M**anagement" color scheme for **VS Code**. This theme is perfect for programmers and script developers looking for a more appealing and professional interface for their work. "Programming and Scripting Management" offers a unique combination of bright colors and subtle lines that make reading code easier and increase productivity.

Also, this theme is an excellent choice for those who work with **Python** and **JavaScript**, particularly in the field of **Data Science**. It combines pleasant tones and improved syntax highlighting, making code easier to read and understand. Moreover, thanks to its greenish hue, the theme is easy on the eyes and code elements are clearly visible. Based on the color scheme of the popular [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which is highly regarded by data scientists.

## Recommended Settings

I recommend using [JetBrain’s Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) mono-spaced font which is useful for both presenting code and working with it in an IDE. It has an increased x-height for a better reading experience, better shapes for seeing columns of letters, and a developer-friendly assortment of ligatures that make all of your multi-character operators actually look like a single, unified operator.

```
{
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, Consolas, monospace",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "editor.fontSize": 12,
  "editor.fontWeight": "normal",
  "editor.letterSpacing": 0.75,
  "editor.lineHeight": 1.3,
  "editor.rulers": [79],
  "editor.stickyScroll.enabled": true,
  "editor.wordWrap": "wordWrapColumn",
  "editor.wordWrapColumn": 79,
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 12,
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Consolas, JetBrains Mono, monospace"

}
```

I recommend to use [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).
